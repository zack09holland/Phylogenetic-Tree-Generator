# Phylogenetic-Tree-Generator
CS241 Data Structures Final Project - Program that builds and manipulates phylogenetic trees using a set of aligned amino acid sequences. By comparing the differences between these sequences, the program will be able to infer a hierarchical structuring of the species reflective of the evolutionary relationships between them.

# Instructions
1. git clone repository
2. Make sure java is installed and set to PATH environment variables
3. Run the program! Below is how to use/run it
```
* usage:
*
* java Program3 fastaListFilename outputDir
*
* where the argument is
* 
*   fastaListFilename      a plaintext file with one line per FASTA alignment file
                            (two have been provided 'species.list' and 'plants.list)
*                            
*   outputDir              a directory where the trees and statistics will be written
*
*
* Note: This will not work unless your outputDir has already been created!
*
* example:
*   java Program3 plants.list output
 ```
