# Phylogenetic-Tree-Generator
CS241 Data Structures Final Project - Program that builds and manipulates phylogenetic trees using a set of aligned amino acid sequences. By comparing the differences between these sequences, the program will be able to infer a hierarchical structuring of the species reflective of the evolutionary relationships between them.
